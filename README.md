# VISIVA Master App

**VISIVA Master App** is the unified source of truth for VISIVA’s brand, documentation, data models, and web platform — designed to scale across design, real estate, and product development.

This repository combines:
- A structured **documentation site** (GitHub Pages)
- **Design and brand assets**
- **JSON-driven configuration**
- A **TypeScript-first PWA scaffold** (Next.js)

Everything is intentionally modular, auditable, and future-proof.

## ✨ Purpose & Vision

VISIVA Master App exists to:

- Centralize **brand governance**
- Enable **consistent design and messaging**
- Support **real estate marketing systems**
- Provide a clean foundation for a **scalable web/PWA platform**

It is not just documentation — it is a **living operating system** for the VISIVA ecosystem.
